**********Information about Medium******************
**********mediumDimension* # means, range of our co-ordinate system in * dimension is [-#/2,#/2]************
**********Please enter below the appropriate value of # in x,y,z direction *********************

*********Specify the length of simulation for a molecule************
*********maxSimulationStep # means, the simulation will generate a maximum of # no. of steps for each molecule, unless it reaches its destination**********
*********maxSimulationTime # means, the simulation will generate no. of steps for each molecule till # nano seconds, unless it reaches its destination**********
*********if maxSimulationStep<=0 then only maxSimulationTime is considered by the program.******************
*********Please enter below the appropriate value of maxSimulationStep or maxSimulationTime****************
 
maxSimulationStep 100000
maxSimulationTime 0
 
********* Specify the positions of positions of sender and receiver.***********
********* distSendReceiver # means, the distance between sender and receiver is # with co-ordinates of sender & receiver as (-#/2,0,0) and (#/2,0,0) respectively.*****
********* It goes unsaid that # of distSendReceiver should be bounded by mediumDimensionX*******************
********* Also in case you want to manually specify the position of sender and receiver, you can do so by setting 'senderPosition' and 'recieverCenter'************
********* if distSendReciever<=0 then only 'senderPosition' and 'recieverCenter' is considered by the program.********
********* Also if you want to assign a sender's position and reciever's center then please enter the co-ordinates within the following boundary***************
********* x-coordinate [-mediumDimensionX/2 , mediumDimensionX/2]
********* y-coordinate [-mediumDimensionY/2 , mediumDimensionY/2]
********* z-coordinate [-mediumDimensionZ/2 , mediumDimensionZ/2]
